## Project Overview
This repository contains the HTML code for the "Core Values" section of the Harvest Innovations website. It showcases three key pillars of the company's philosophy through interactive card elements: Planting Innovation, Harvest Innovations, and Modern Agriculture. The design features a responsive grid layout with hover effects, gradient backgrounds, and Unsplash-sourced images to create an engaging visual experience focused on agricultural innovation.

## Features
- **Responsive Design**: Uses CSS Grid for flexible card layout that adapts to different screen sizes (e.g., mobile-friendly at max-width 768px).
- **Hover Interactions**: Cards include scaling images, overlay transitions, and arrow buttons for a modern, interactive feel.
- **Styling**: Employs linear gradients, blur effects (backdrop-filter), and shadows for a premium, glassmorphism-inspired aesthetic.
- **Images**: Placeholder images from Unsplash depicting rice planting, farmers, and modern tractors to align with agricultural themes.
- **Structure**: Simple HTML structure with CSS in `<style>` tag; no external dependencies.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repo-url>`
2. Open `core values section.html` in any modern web browser.

## Usage
- Embed this section into a larger website by copying the HTML/CSS into your project.
- Customize images by replacing Unsplash URLs.
- Modify card titles and links (e.g., `<a href="#planting">`) to point to actual sections.
- For production, extract CSS to a separate file for better maintainability.

## Dependencies
- None (pure HTML/CSS).
- Tested on modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari).

# Project Description

The "Core Values Section" is a visually striking HTML component designed for the Harvest Innovations website. It presents the company's core values through three elegantly styled cards, each representing a facet of agricultural advancement: "Planting Innovation" (focusing on innovative planting techniques), "Harvest Innovations" (emphasizing cutting-edge harvesting methods), and "Modern Agriculture" (highlighting contemporary farming technologies). Built with pure HTML and CSS, it features a gradient background, responsive grid, and interactive hover effects including image scaling, overlay slides, and blurred glass-like panels. Images are sourced from Unsplash to evoke themes of sustainability and progress in farming. This section serves as an inspirational gateway, encouraging users to explore deeper into the site's content via anchor links.
